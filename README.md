# Captioning on Glass: Group Conversations

## Prerequisites

#### SDL

This project depends heavily on a library called [SDL](https://libsdl.org), or **S**imple **D**irectMedia **L**ayer. SDL
is in charge of rendering most of our content to the screen.

##### Instructions

Perform the following _OUTSIDE OF THIS REPOSITORY_. Your "Downloads" folder will work fine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
cd SDL
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Development

Most development of this repository has been done using [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), which is the
recommended development tool for this repository.
[JetBrains offers free educational licenses to students](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students), which
should make getting CLion a cinch.
