00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.800
All right, let's get started. You heard what the judge said: one man is dead, and now

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.960
we must decide if another man
will live or die. Premeditated murder

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.920
is the most serious charge in our courts. If we
vote guilty, we send him to the electric chair.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.040
That's mandatory. Did the bailiff lock us in here? What do they think we are, crooks? They lock us in

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.920
here for a little while. It's standard procedure to
lock the door, they don't want anyone sneaking off.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.080
as i was saying if there is a reasonable doubt
in your minds we must declare the defendant

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.600
inaugural team i think we all know that none
of us were asleep in there yes well this is a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.760
serious business and i want to make sure we
all have a clear idea about why we are here

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.560
he also said that if there was no reasonable
doubt we must find him guilty am i right the kid's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.840
obviously guilty the judge said if we unanimously
determine that there is no reasonable doubt

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:07.360
then he must be found guilty our verdict must be
unanimous one way or another guilty or not guilty

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:17.760
that's the law i say let's call for a vote i'll
vote anybody doesn't want to vote all right this

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.840
has to be a four to nothing vote either way are
we ready all those voting guilty raise your hands

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.440
boy oh boy there's always one okay not guilty

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.640
i want right okay three to one guilty now i
know where we stand he knifed his own father

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.440
four inches in the chests they
proved it a dozen different ways

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.280
do you want me to listen for you no then what
do you want nothing i just want to talk if we

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.520
are condemning him to die at least we can give
him a few minutes of our time what's your hurry

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.880
no no hurry this case is just pretty
obvious why i was convinced the first day

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.960
what's there to talk about he's guilty suppose
you're wrong i'm not saying i believe a story

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.120
or not maybe i don't so why jabot not guilty
it's not so easy for me to raise my hand and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.800
send a boy off to die without asking talking
about it first who says it's easy for me no one

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:37.680
the old man heard him yell that he was going to
kill his father in his own words he is telling

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.680
us what he did how many times have each of us
said i could kill you for doing that or if you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.600
do that once more i'll kill you we say it every
day it doesn't mean we're going to kill someone

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.160
the kid said he was going to kill
him and did kill him end of story

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.320
so what's bothering you why don't you think he's
guilty i'd like to hear yes i agree let's hear

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.920
your reasons we want to give this boy a fair trial
that's our mandate maybe no reason but let's look

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.480
at this boy's situation kicked around all his life
smothered dead since he was nine his father in and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.320
out of jail this boy has grown up in the school
of hard knocks and he's wild and angry you know

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.200
why he's like that because someone knocked him on
the head once a day every day he's had a pretty

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.080
terrible 19 years we just owe him a few words
that's all we don't owe him anything he's a killer

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.640
i've listened to words all week the prosecutor
the defense attorney the witness the judge and

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.720
don't tell me you're taking this kid's testimony
seriously he's a born liar all his kind are only

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.920
an ignorant man can believe that now listen just
because this kid is a different color than you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.840
don't take it personally we're all
adults here let's get to the facts

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.560
well what if the boy's story is true we'd
be condemning him to die in false testimony

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.800
but certainly you're not suggesting
that all the witnesses were lying

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.400
no but maybe they think they saw something when
they really didn't it's possible what are you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.440
rambling about the woman claimed to see the murder
from across the street just as the lights went out

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.880
yeah she said that she couldn't sleep she was
in bed and happened to be looking across the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.120
way at their apartment when she saw him stab his
father she's claiming that she could recognize

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.040
this boy from 60 feet away as the lights went
out what if she thought she saw him but it was

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.880
really someone else she stood in the courtroom
and said she saw it play in this day why would

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.960
she lie i'd like to ask you something you
don't believe the boy how come you believe

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:49.120
the woman she's one of them too isn't she you're
a pretty smart fellow aren't you okay take it easy

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.880
who made you so wise what are
you the kid's guardian angel

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.840
he's got nothing

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.200
the woman wouldn't lie

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.400
she had no reason to i've got to agree why would
she purge her herself she has nothing to gain

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.560
i'm saying that it's possible she saw someone
else the boy claimed he was at the movies

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.240
the movies were a load of crap this kid
couldn't even remember the name of the movie

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.920
he was supposed to have
seen don't you remember the

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.320
the cops testimony i'm telling you the kid
made it up no one could confirm his alibi

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.880
this kid stinks of the gutter i've lived in
a slum all my life i used to play around in

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.720
a backyard that was filled with garbage maybe
it still smells on me gentlemen now let's be

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.040
reasonable the facts are that two witnesses
saw him stab his father at exactly 12 10 a.m

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.400
no that's not right only the woman claimed to
have seen it what do you mean claimed she saw it

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.520
he's confusing you the old man only heard
the body fall he didn't see the stabbing

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.160
then he saw he said he saw the kid running
down the stairs and out of the house so he

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.720
called police i'm asking you could the old man
really see the person running down the stairs

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.360
his vision isn't very good it was dark is it
possible it was someone else is it possible that

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.640
you're wasting our time you keep going around in
circles is there a reasonable doubt that it could

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.720
have been someone else that's the question the old
man could have seen him he wasn't that far away

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.120
that's true but the woman was
far away wasn't she about 60 feet

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.440
why are you rubbing your nose like that i beg your
pardon i want to know why you're rubbing your nose

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.680
well if it's any of your business i was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little bit

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.520
is it because of your eyeglasses it is now could
we get onto something else your eyeglasses make

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.520
those deep impressions on the sides of your
nose i never noticed that before they must

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:17.840
be annoying they are annoying i wouldn't know 20
20. come on already with this optometrist um the

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.160
woman who testified that she saw the killing
had the same marks on the sides of her nose

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.880
you're right she kept rubbing them in the
courtroom right this woman was about 45 years old

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.880
but she tried to look 35 did you notice that all
that makeup her hair dyed the brand new clothes

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:43.280
and no eyeglasses what do you mean no eyeglasses
you don't know that she wore glasses just because

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.840
she was rubbing her nose listen i saw them too
i was the one closest to her she had these marks

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.280
could those marks be made by anything other than
eyeglasses no they couldn't do you wear glasses

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.800
when you go to bed no one does so it's logical
to assume that if she was trying to fall asleep

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.960
and look casually out the window she couldn't
see much without her glasses on especially from

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:13.200
60 feet away she wouldn't have seen anything
you don't know what kind of glasses she wore

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.960
you're guessing they could have been
sunglasses and here's another guess

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.040
maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father i say that she only saw a blur

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.720
you haven't convinced anyone i call for another
vote what's your hurry are you his executioner

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.800
i'm one of them maybe you'd like to pull the
switch for this kid you bet i would i feel sorry

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:46.880
for you listen shut up what it must feel like
to want to pull the switch i'm telling you now

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.840
shut up ever since we walked into this room you've
been behaving like a self-appointed public avenger

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.600
listen shut up you want to see this boy die
because you personally want it not because

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:10.960
of the facts shut up you're a sadist i'll kill
you you don't really mean you'll kill me do you

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.840
another vote has been called
for that's vote guilty

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:31.440
not guilty
